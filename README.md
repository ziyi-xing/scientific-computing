# Scientific Computing Coursework

This repository contains solutions for assignments in the Scientific Computing course. Each assignment is structured into separate folders with relevant code and figures.

## Repository Structure

- `scientific_computing_homework1/`
  - `src/`: Contains Python scripts for the first assignment.
    - `exercise_1.py`: Solution for Set 1, Question 1.
    - `exercise_2.py`: Solution for Set 1, Question 2.
    - `exercise_3-6.py`: Solutions for Set 1, Questions 3-6.
  - `figures/`: Stores generated figures from simulations.

- `scientific_computing_homework2/`
  - `src/`: Contains Python scripts for the second assignment.
    - `exercise_2.1.py`: Solution for Set 2, Question 1(Diffusion Limited Aggregation).
    - `exercise_2.3.py`: Solution for Set 2, Question 3 (Gray-Scott model).
  - `figures/`: Stores images and animations generated from simulations.

## Usage

Clone the repository and navigate to the relevant assignment directory. Run the scripts in the `src/` folder to execute simulations and generate results.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ziyi-xing/scientific-computing.git
cd scientific_computing_homework2/src
python exercise_2.3.py

```markdown
## Dependencies

The scripts require the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

To install the required dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
